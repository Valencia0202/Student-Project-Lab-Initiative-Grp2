Student Project Lab Initiative – Group 2

Welcome to the official repository for Student Project Lab Initiative – Group 2. This project showcases a cross-platform application designed to streamline student project workflows, laboratory resource usage, and innovative sustainability initiatives.

🚀 Project Overview

The Student Project Lab Initiative – Group 2 focuses on the development of an innovative, gamified recycling system aimed at promoting sustainable behaviour through technology. The application runs seamlessly across Web, Android, and iOS platforms using a shared Flutter codebase.

📘 Project Description (Formal Academic Tone)

The project introduces a gamified recycling platform that encourages environmentally responsible behaviour by integrating material recognition technology and a reward-based user experience. Users can scan recyclable materials using the in-app recognition system to identify the item. After properly disposing of the material in the designated bin, users validate the action by scanning a unique verification code located in the return area.

Through this two-step process—material scanning and disposal confirmation—users accumulate points, reinforcing positive recycling habits. The system is designed to:

Improve public awareness of proper recycling classification

Encourage long-term environmentally friendly behaviour

Reduce recycling contamination through guided instructions

Provide real-time, interactive feedback to enhance user engagement

This initiative serves as a prototype exploring how gamified digital interventions can facilitate behavioural change, community participation, and sustainability education.
